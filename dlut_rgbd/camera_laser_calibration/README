Usage
-------------------
rosrun camera_laser_calibration detect_image_corners  [image_file_name] [p1] [p2] [p3] 
[image_file_name] : your image file name;
[p1] : Value of red channel ,such as 100
[p2] : Value of green and blue channel ,such as 80 
[p3] : The difference berween value of green and blue.

rosrun camera_laser_calibration detect_laser_corners [pcd file name]
[pcd file name] : Your pcd file name.

rosrun camera_laser_calibration calculate_RT [first_file_number] [all_file_number]
[first_file_number] : Because many times calibration is needed ,so you may have many file,we define as visionpts0-visionpts3 and laserpts0-laserpts3.Here is your first image file or first point cloud file number.
[all_file_number] : How many files are read in.
